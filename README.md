📦 ragstack-gpt-observability
A production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, Kafka-based metadata logging, and observability using Prometheus and Grafana. Built with FastAPI, LangChain, and ChromaDB, this project serves as an intelligent query engine that combines LLM capabilities with your private data and full-stack monitoring.

🚀 Features Implemented
✅ 1. LLM-Powered Query Engine (FastAPI + GPT-4)
Built with FastAPI to expose a /query endpoint

Accepts user input and generates intelligent answers using OpenAI’s GPT-4

Integrated with LangChain for seamless prompt handling

✅ 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Uses Chroma vector database to store and retrieve your private data

Implements a RAG pipeline: retrieve relevant chunks → augment question → send to GPT-4

Embedded with OpenAIEmbeddings for document vectorization

Custom prompt template provided to control LLM context behavior

✅ 3. RAG Engine (rag_engine.py)
Modular engine handles end-to-end: retrieval → prompt construction → GPT-4 call

Automatically extracts source document IDs (doc_ids) used for response

Configurable via environment variables (model version, top-k, etc.)

✅ 4. Metadata Generation Protocol (MCP)
Every user query is wrapped in a structured MCP payload containing:

user ID, request ID, timestamp

prompt version, model version, document IDs used

Centralized in mcp.py for reusability

✅ 5. Kafka Integration for Query Events
kafka_producer.py sends MCP metadata to Kafka topic: query-events

Decouples logging/analytics from core app logic

Ensures real-time event stream for monitoring, tracing, and alerting

✅ 6. Production-Ready Code Structure
backend directory contains all core services

.env driven configuration

Scalable structure for multi-service support (indexer, logger, dashboards, etc.)

Ready to extend with Docker, Kubernetes, ArgoCD, and CI/CD

🧠 Tech Stack
🔗 LangChain (RAG logic)

🧠 OpenAI GPT-4 (LLM inference)

💾 ChromaDB (vector storage)

🧰 FastAPI (API server)

📨 Apache Kafka (event broker)

📊 Prometheus + Grafana (monitoring/tracing)

🧾 Loki (query logging - future)

📦 Docker, ArgoCD (deployment)

🧪 Example Query Flow
User sends a POST /query with: "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?"

FastAPI calls rag_engine.get_answer()

Embeds question

Retrieves relevant docs from ChromaDB

Constructs prompt and calls GPT-4

Returns the answer

Generates MCP metadata and sends it to Kafka topic: query-events

📦 Next Steps (in progress)
 Vector Indexer microservice (Go/Kafka)

 Real-time Logger service with Loki

 Grafana dashboard for query stats

 Docker Compose setup for local testing

 Kubernetes deployment using Helm & ArgoCD
